# Odd-One-Out

This Project Finds the odd word from a given list of words.

It Uses Word2Vec Model which is a pre trained model by Google. It has a 300 sized vector for each word.

Words in a similar context have similar vectors. SO the Odd word is the most unsimilar to the average vector.

Similarity is calculated using cosine similarity.
